\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a regime-adaptive portfolio framework combining Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) regime detection and XGBoost prediction. Using CRSP data (1965--2024), a GPU-accelerated HRP portfolio is constructed with RMT denoising and a forward-only HMM filter using log returns, downside deviation, and Michigan Consumer Sentiment. The regime-adaptive strategy achieves a Sharpe ratio of 0.85 vs.\ 0.51 for static HRP and 0.54 for the market, after transaction costs. Critically, maximum drawdown falls from 45.7\% to 21.0\%, with all five worst drawdowns ($-$21.0\% to $-$13.5\%) smaller than static HRP's \textit{fifth} worst ($-$22.3\%). The XGBoost model achieves 66.2\% accuracy with 72.9\% bear recall out-of-sample.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In 1952, Harry Markowitz introduced Modern Portfolio Theory to the world and revolutionized the way portfolio managers allocate capital \cite{markowitz1952}. Most subsequent models and theories stem from this foundational work and its method for solving portfolio weights to minimize risk given a target return---or simply minimizing risk as a primary objective (the Global Minimum Variance Portfolio). Despite the elegance of its solution, several problems arise: How can the expected return vector be estimated reliably? How should the covariance matrix be inverted given a large number of assets? What is the appropriate risk aversion coefficient for a given investor?

While these questions were partially addressed in subsequent decades, the inversion of the covariance matrix remains problematic: it magnifies estimation errors at best, and sometimes the matrix cannot even be inverted due to singularity \cite{michaud1989}. Almost seventy years after Markowitz, in the paper ``Building Diversified Portfolios that Outperform Out-of-Sample,'' Marcos López de Prado proposed a machine learning framework---Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP)---that does not require covariance matrix inversion to minimize risk \cite{lopez2016}. His methodology demonstrated less concentration in portfolio composition as well as reduced out-of-sample volatility and drawdown compared to mean-variance optimization.

The current paper aspires to address a problem that both of these methodologies face: the assumption of stationary market conditions.

% 2. RESEARCH QUESTION & LITERATURE
%==============================================================================
\section{Research Question \& Literature}
\label{sec:research}

Several assumptions in portfolio optimization are so widely accepted that they are rarely questioned:

\paragraph{Is variance the right metric to minimize?}
Most investors would gladly accept upside volatility---it is the \textit{downside} that destroys wealth. Fishburn \cite{fishburn1977} formalized this asymmetry with lower partial moments (LPM), showing that mean-variance optimization is merely a special case of a broader framework that penalizes only below-target returns. A 50\% loss requires a 100\% gain just to break even; a 20\% loss requires only 25\%. This mathematical and psychological asymmetry suggests that drawdown reduction may be more valuable than variance reduction.

\paragraph{Are correlations reliable when they matter most?}
Longin and Solnik \cite{longin2001} highlight a critical property of equity markets: correlations increase dramatically during market stress. In other words, estimated correlations become unreliable precisely when diversification is most needed. Ang and Bekaert \cite{ang2002} further develop the relationship between correlation spikes and drawdowns in diversified holdings, showing that regime-switching models can capture these dynamics.

\paragraph{Research Question.}
These observations motivate a natural question: \textit{Can portfolio construction capture the benefits of diversification in calm markets while dynamically reducing exposure before drawdowns materialize?}

\paragraph{Contributions.}
This work makes four contributions: (1) GPU-accelerated HRP with Random Matrix Theory denoising following Marchenko and Pastur \cite{marchenko1967} and Laloux et al.\ \cite{laloux1999}; (2) A forward-only HMM filter that avoids look-ahead bias from standard smoothed posteriors as in Hamilton \cite{hamilton1989}, combined with XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin \cite{chen2016}) for regime prediction; (3) Walk-forward backtesting with purged cross-validation following L\'opez de Prado \cite{lopez2018}; (4) Empirical evidence that drawdown reduction---not Sharpe ratio improvement---is the primary achievement.

\paragraph{Related Work.}
HRP was extended to multi-period settings by Raffinot \cite{raffinot2018}. Regime-switching models for asset allocation were studied by Ang and Bekaert \cite{ang2002} and Guidolin and Timmermann \cite{guidolin2007}. Machine learning for return prediction was surveyed by Gu, Kelly, and Xiu \cite{gu2020}. Consumer sentiment as a market predictor was examined by Lemmon and Portniaguina \cite{lemmon2006}. This work bridges HRP and ML-based regime prediction---a gap in the existing literature.

% 3. METHODOLOGY
%==============================================================================
\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

The methodology consists of two parts: (1) the base HRP portfolio construction with RMT denoising, and (2) the regime-adaptive enhancement using HMM and XGBoost. This section presents a detailed 7-stage pipeline for Part 1 and a 6-phase pipeline for Part 2.

\subsection{Part 1: Hierarchical Risk Parity}

The HRP weight computation follows a 7-stage pipeline executed at each monthly rebalancing date. \Cref{fig:hrp-pipeline} provides a visual overview of this process.

\label{fig:hrp-pipeline}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Stage 1: Universe Construction}
At each rebalancing date $t$, the investable universe is constructed from CRSP common shares (SHRCD $\in \{10, 11\}$) listed on NYSE, NASDAQ, or AMEX (EXCHCD $\in \{1, 2, 3\}$). A two-stage liquidity filter is then applied within each Fama-French 12 industry classification:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{U}_t = \left\{ i : V^{med}_{i,t} \geq Q_{80\%}(V^{med}_{ind(i),t}) \text{ and } P_{i,t} > \$3 \right\}
\end{equation}
where $V^{med}_{i,t}$ is the rolling 12-month median dollar volume (with minimum 6 valid observations), and $Q_{80\%}$ denotes the 80th percentile within each industry. This selects the top 20\% most liquid stocks per industry while excluding penny stocks.

\subsubsection{Stage 2: Return Extraction}
For each rebalancing date $t$, a 60-month ($T=60$) lookback window of returns is extracted for $N$ stocks passing the universe filter. Only stocks with all 60 monthly returns available are included:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{R}_{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N}, \quad \text{where } R_{s,i} = r_{i,s} \text{ for } s \in [t-59, t]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Stage 3: RMT Covariance Denoising}
Sample covariance matrices are notoriously noisy when $N$ approaches $T$. Random Matrix Theory (RMT) denoising is applied following Laloux et al.\ \cite{laloux1999}:

\paragraph{Step 3a: Decomposition.} Convert the covariance matrix to a correlation matrix $\mathbf{C}$ while preserving individual volatilities $\sigma_i$.

\paragraph{Step 3b: Eigendecomposition.}
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{C} = \mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^\top, \quad \boldsymbol{\Lambda} = \text{diag}(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_N)
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Step 3c: Marchenko-Pastur Threshold.} The threshold separating signal from noise eigenvalues is:
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_{\max} = \hat{\sigma}^2 \left(1 + \sqrt{\frac{N}{T}}\right)^2
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\sigma}^2 = \text{median}(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_N)$ is a robust estimator of the noise variance (Laloux et al.\ \cite{laloux1999}).

\paragraph{Step 3d: Denoising.} Eigenvalues below $\lambda_{\max}$ are replaced with their mean:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\lambda}_k = \begin{cases}
        \lambda_k & \text{if } \lambda_k > \lambda_{\max} \text{ (signal)} \\
        \bar{\lambda}_{noise} & \text{otherwise (noise)}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Step 3e: Reconstruction.} The denoised correlation matrix is reconstructed as $\tilde{\mathbf{C}} = \mathbf{V} \tilde{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}} \mathbf{V}^\top$, then converted back to covariance: $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}} = \text{diag}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) \cdot \tilde{\mathbf{C}} \cdot \text{diag}(\boldsymbol{\sigma})$.

\subsubsection{Stage 4: Distance Matrix Construction}
The denoised correlation matrix is converted to a distance matrix using a two-step process following L\'opez de Prado \cite{lopez2016}:

\paragraph{Step 4a: Correlation Distance.} First, the angular distance between each pair of assets is computed:
\begin{equation}
    d_{i,j} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(1 - \rho_{i,j})} \in [0, 1]
\end{equation}
This maps perfect correlation ($\rho=1$) to zero distance and perfect anti-correlation ($\rho=-1$) to maximum distance.

\paragraph{Step 4b: Euclidean Distance on Correlation Profiles.} Second, the Euclidean distance between each asset's correlation profile (i.e., its row in the distance matrix) is computed:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{d}_{i,j} = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{N} (d_{k,i} - d_{k,j})^2}
\end{equation}
This captures how similarly two assets correlate with the \textit{entire universe}. Two assets may have similar pairwise correlation but very different correlation patterns with other assets; this step distinguishes them.

\subsubsection{Stage 5: Hierarchical Clustering}
Ward's method \cite{ward1963} performs agglomerative clustering by iteratively merging the pair of clusters that minimizes the increase in total within-cluster variance:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta(A, B) = \frac{n_A n_B}{n_A + n_B} \| \bar{d}_A - \bar{d}_B \|^2
\end{equation}
The output is a dendrogram (binary tree) representing the hierarchical structure of asset similarities.

\subsubsection{Stage 6: Quasi-Diagonalization (Seriation)}
The dendrogram is reordered so that similar assets are placed adjacent, producing a quasi-diagonal covariance matrix. This seriation step traverses the tree and orders leaves such that the largest cluster elements appear first, creating a banded structure that facilitates the recursive bisection.

\subsubsection{Stage 7: Recursive Bisection}
Weights are allocated through top-down recursive bisection of the seriated dendrogram. At each node splitting cluster $C$ into $C_1$ and $C_2$:
\begin{equation}
    \alpha = 1 - \frac{\tilde{V}_{C_1}}{\tilde{V}_{C_1} + \tilde{V}_{C_2}}, \quad w_{C_1} = \alpha \cdot w_C, \quad w_{C_2} = (1-\alpha) \cdot w_C
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{V}_C$ is the cluster variance computed as an inverse-variance portfolio:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{V}_C = \left( \sum_{i \in C} \frac{1}{\sigma_i^2} \right)^{-1} \cdot \mathbf{1}^\top \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_C^{-1} \mathbf{1}
\end{equation}
This allocates more weight to the lower-variance branch at each split, producing a risk-balanced portfolio without matrix inversion of the full covariance matrix.

\subsection{Part 2: Regime-Adaptive Enhancement}

The regime-adaptive enhancement follows a 6-phase pipeline that predicts market regimes and adjusts portfolio exposure accordingly. \Cref{fig:ml-pipeline} illustrates the complete workflow.

\label{fig:ml-pipeline}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Phase 1: Data Construction (HMM Input)}

A 3-dimensional observation vector is constructed for the HMM using HRP strategy returns and consumer sentiment, as shown in \Cref{fig:hmm-input}:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{O}_t = \begin{bmatrix} \text{log\_return}_t^z \\ \text{downside\_dev}_t^z \\ \text{sent\_change}_t^z \end{bmatrix}

\caption{HMM Input Construction. Three features are derived from HRP returns and Michigan Consumer Sentiment: (1) log returns capture momentum, (2) 6-month rolling downside deviation captures left-tail risk, and (3) YoY sentiment change captures consumer confidence shifts. All features are standardized using expanding Z-scores computed from past data only.}
\label{fig:hmm-input}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Log Returns.} $\text{log\_return}_t = \ln(1 + r_t^{HRP})$

\paragraph{Rolling Downside Deviation.} Computed over a 6-month window, capturing left-tail risk:
\begin{equation}
    \text{DD}_t = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{s=t-5}^{t} \min(r_s, 0)^2}
\end{equation}
Only negative returns contribute to downside deviation. The 6-month window provides sufficient responsiveness to regime shifts while maintaining statistical stability.

\paragraph{Michigan Consumer Sentiment Change.} Year-over-year percentage change in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (ICS), lagged one month for publication delay:
\begin{equation}
    \text{sent\_change}_t = \frac{ICS_{t-1}}{ICS_{t-13}} - 1
\end{equation}
Consumer sentiment is a leading indicator of economic activity and has been shown to predict equity returns (Lemmon and Portniaguina \cite{lemmon2006}).

\paragraph{Expanding Z-Score (No Look-Ahead Bias).} Each feature is standardized using \textit{only past data}:
\begin{equation}
    z_t = \frac{x_t - \bar{x}_{1:t-1}}{\sigma_{1:t-1}}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{x}_{1:t-1}$ and $\sigma_{1:t-1}$ are computed on observations strictly before time $t$.

\subsubsection{Phase 2: Regime Identification (Hidden Markov Model)}

Market regimes are modeled as a 2-state Gaussian HMM with 3-dimensional observations. The model parameters are $\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\boldsymbol{\pi}, \mathbf{A}, \boldsymbol{\mu}_0, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_0, \boldsymbol{\mu}_1, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_1)$, where $\boldsymbol{\mu}_k \in \mathbb{R}^3$ and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$ for $k \in \{0, 1\}$.

\paragraph{Forward-Only Filter (Critical for Avoiding Look-Ahead Bias).}
Standard HMM inference uses the forward-backward algorithm, which computes \textit{smoothed} posteriors $P(q_t | O_{1:T})$ using future observations---a severe form of look-ahead bias. A forward-only filter is implemented, computing \textit{filtered} posteriors:
\begin{equation}
    P(q_t = j | O_{1:t}) = \frac{\alpha_t(j)}{\sum_{k} \alpha_t(k)}
\end{equation}
where the forward variable $\alpha_t(j) = P(O_{1:t}, q_t = j)$ is computed recursively:
\begin{equation}
    \alpha_t(j) = P(O_t | q_t = j) \sum_{i} \alpha_{t-1}(i) \cdot A_{ij}
\end{equation}
This ensures regime labels use only information available at time $t$.

\Cref{fig:forward-filter} illustrates the critical difference between the two approaches.

\label{fig:forward-filter}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{State Labeling.} After fitting, states are relabeled by mean return: the state with lower mean return is ``Bear'' (0), higher mean is ``Bull'' (1).

\paragraph{Expanding-Window HMM Fitting.} The HMM is re-estimated every 12 months using all available data up to time $t$, starting after a 60-month burn-in period.

\subsubsection{Phase 3: Feature Engineering}

14 predictive features are constructed across four categories, all designed to predict the \textit{next month's} regime. \Cref{tab:features} summarizes the features; detailed formulas are provided in \Cref{app:features}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Feature Categories and Descriptions (see \Cref{app:features} for formulas)}
\label{tab:features}
\begin{tabular}{lllc}
\toprule
Category & Feature & Description & Z Window \\
\midrule
Cross-sectional & \texttt{dispersion\_z} & Cross-sectional return std & 36M \\
& \texttt{amihud\_z} & Median Amihud illiquidity & 36M \\
& \texttt{bab\_z} & BAB factor 12M momentum & 60M \\
& \texttt{avg\_pairwise\_corr\_z} & Variance ratio proxy & 60M \\
\midrule

& \texttt{term\_spread} & 10Y $-$ 3M Treasury & 60M \\
& \texttt{cpi\_vol} & CPI 24M rolling volatility & 60M \\
& \texttt{m2\_growth} & M2 YoY growth & 60M \\
& \texttt{unrate\_trend} & UNRATE deviation from 12M MA & 60M \\
\midrule
Factor & \texttt{valuation\_spread\_z} & Value spread log(Q5/Q1 B/M) & 60M \\

\midrule

Momentum & \texttt{hrp\_mom\_3m\_z} & 3-month cumulative return & 24M \\
& \texttt{hrp\_mom\_12m\_z} & 12-month cumulative return & 24M \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Rolling Z-Score with Lag.} All Z-scored features use the formula:
\begin{equation}
    z_t = \frac{x_t - \bar{x}_{t-W:t-1}}{\sigma_{t-W:t-1}}
\end{equation}
where $W$ is the rolling window (24--60 months depending on feature). The \texttt{shift(1)} ensures strictly ex-ante normalization.

\paragraph{Macro Data Lags.} CPI, M2, and UNRATE are lagged by 1 month to account for publication delay; interest rates are available in real-time.

\paragraph{Target Variable.} Features at time $t$ predict the regime at time $t+1$: $y_t = \text{regime}_{t+1}$.

\subsubsection{Phase 4: Walk-Forward XGBoost Prediction}

Next month's regime is predicted using XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin \cite{chen2016}) with a rigorous walk-forward protocol.

\paragraph{Purged Time-Series Cross-Validation.}
To prevent information leakage from overlapping features (e.g., 12-month momentum overlaps with 12-month regime patterns), purged CV is implemented following L\'opez de Prado \cite{lopez2018}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{purge\_gap} = 12 months: removes observations between train and test folds
    \item \textbf{embargo\_pct} = 1\%: additional buffer after test folds
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Walk-Forward Protocol.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize at month 120 (10 years minimum training)
    \item At each refit point (every 12 months):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Winsorize} features at 1\%/99\% using training bounds only
        \item \textbf{Select features} via permutation importance with purged CV
        \item \textbf{Tune hyperparameters} with Optuna (20 trials) using purged CV
        \item \textbf{Train} final XGBoost model on all available training data
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Generate out-of-sample predictions for next 12 months
    \item Advance window and repeat
\end{enumerate}

All three operations (winsorization, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning) occur \textit{inside} the walk-forward loop using only training data, preventing any form of look-ahead bias. \Cref{fig:walk-forward} illustrates this expanding-window approach.

\subsubsection{Phase 5: Portfolio Overlay (Two-Fund Separation)}

The regime prediction adjusts HRP exposure through a two-fund separation framework, illustrated in \Cref{fig:two-fund}:
\begin{equation}
    r_{portfolio,t} = w_t \cdot r_{HRP,t} + (1 - w_t) \cdot r_{f,t}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    node[midway, below=8pt, font=\scriptsize, text=green!60!black] {Earn $r_f$};

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Two-Fund Separation Framework. The leverage ratio $L_t$ determines the allocation between the HRP portfolio and T-Bills. When $L_t < 1$ (defensive), the investor holds cash earning $r_f$. When $L_t > 1$ (leveraged), the investor borrows at $r_f + s$ to increase HRP exposure. The P(Bull)-scaled strategy sets $L_t = P(\text{Bull}_t) \times \kappa$.}
\label{fig:two-fund}
\end{figure}

For the P(Bull)-scaled strategy:
\begin{equation}
    w_t = P(\text{Bull}_t) \times \frac{1}{\bar{P}(\text{Bull})}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{P}(\text{Bull})$ is the historical mean bull probability. This scaling ensures mean leverage equals 1 (fair comparison with buy-and-hold HRP).

\paragraph{Note on Look-Ahead Bias.}
It is acknowledged that using the full-sample mean $\bar{P}(\text{Bull})$ introduces a minor form of look-ahead bias, as the scaling factor is computed over the entire backtest period. However, this choice is made \textit{solely for comparison purposes}: it ensures that the regime-adaptive strategy has the same average equity exposure as buy-and-hold HRP, isolating the timing effect from any leverage effect. In a live implementation, a practitioner would replace $1/\bar{P}(\text{Bull})$ with a constant $\kappa$ calibrated to their risk aversion level:
\begin{equation}
    w_t = \kappa \cdot P(\text{Bull}_t)
\end{equation}
where $\kappa$ controls the aggressiveness of the strategy. This eliminates any look-ahead bias while preserving the regime-timing signal.

\paragraph{Leverage Mechanics and Financing Costs.}
Asymmetric financing costs are modeled reflecting real-world borrowing constraints \cite{ibkr2025}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item When $w_t < 1$: Hold $(1-w_t)$ in 1-month T-Bills, earning the risk-free rate $r_f$
    \item When $w_t > 1$: Borrow $(w_t-1)$ at $r_f + s$ to lever up HRP exposure, where $s$ is the financing spread
\end{itemize}

The portfolio return under leverage is:
\begin{equation}
    r_{portfolio,t} = \begin{cases}
        w_t \cdot r_{HRP,t} + (1-w_t) \cdot r_f & \text{if } w_t \leq 1 \text{ (long T-Bills)} \\
        w_t \cdot r_{HRP,t} - (w_t-1) \cdot (r_f + s) & \text{if } w_t > 1 \text{ (borrowing)}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The spread is set at $s = 50$ basis points, consistent with institutional margin rates for portfolios in the \$50M--\$250M AUM range.

\subsubsection{Phase 6: Transaction Cost Analysis}

Three layers of costs are modeled with careful attention to drift-adjusted turnover and both sides of leverage trades. \Cref{fig:tx-costs} provides a visual breakdown.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Transaction Cost Breakdown. GROSS returns assume no trading costs and borrowing at $r_f$. NET returns subtract three cost components: (1) inner costs from HRP portfolio rebalancing scaled by leverage, (2) outer costs from leverage changes (charged on both sides), and (3) financing spread paid only when leveraged ($L_t > 1$).}
\label{fig:tx-costs}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Inner Cost (HRP Rebalancing).}
A common error in turnover calculation is comparing target weights at consecutive dates: $|w_{i,t}^{Target} - w_{i,t-1}^{Target}|$. This \textit{underestimates} true turnover because it ignores price drift during the holding period. If a stock doubles in price, its weight in the portfolio also doubles before any trading occurs.

\textit{Drift-adjusted turnover} is computed as:
\begin{equation}
    \text{inner}_t = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} |w_{i,t}^{Target} - w_{i,t}^{Drifted}| \right) \times C_{bps}
\end{equation}
where the drifted weight reflects how the portfolio evolved due to differential returns:
\begin{equation}
    w_{i,t}^{Drifted} = w_{i,t-1}^{Target} \times \frac{1 + r_{i,t}}{1 + r_{portfolio,t}}
\end{equation}
This captures the actual trading required: from where the portfolio \textit{drifted to} the new target weights.

\paragraph{Outer Cost (Leverage Overlay).}
When changing the leverage ratio, the investor trades \textit{both} sides:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If increasing leverage ($L_t > L_{t-1}$): Buy HRP stocks AND sell T-Bills
    \item If decreasing leverage ($L_t < L_{t-1}$): Sell HRP stocks AND buy T-Bills
\end{itemize}
Therefore, the outer cost charges both sides of the trade:
\begin{equation}
    \text{outer}_t = 2 \times |L_t - L_{t-1}| \times C_{bps}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Net Returns.}
The final net return incorporates transaction costs and financing spreads:
\begin{equation}
    r_{net,t} = r_{portfolio,t}^{financed} - \text{inner}_t \cdot L_t - \text{outer}_t
\end{equation}
where $r_{portfolio,t}^{financed}$ is the gross return including the asymmetric financing cost from Phase 5.

% 4. DATA DESCRIPTION
%==============================================================================
\section{Data Description}
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Data Sources}

This analysis integrates four primary data sources spanning 1960--2024:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Data Sources and Coverage}
\label{tab:data}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
Source & Variables & Frequency & Coverage \\
\midrule
CRSP & Stock returns, prices, volume & Monthly & 1960--2024 \\
Compustat & Book equity (seqq) & Quarterly & 1970--2024 \\
FRED & BAA, DGS10, TB3MS, CPI, M2, UNRATE, UMICH ICS & Monthly & 1960--2024 \\
Fama-French & Industry classifications, factors & Monthly & 1960--2024 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{CRSP Stock Data}

The CRSP dataset contains monthly returns for all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks. Key preprocessing steps include:

\paragraph{Delisting Return Adjustment.}
Following Shumway \cite{shumway1997}, delisting bias is adjusted for:
\begin{equation}
    r_{adjusted} = \begin{cases}
        (1 + r_t)(1 + r_{delist}) - 1 & \text{if delisting in month } t \\
        r_t & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $r_{delist}$ is the delisting return from CRSP.

\paragraph{Liquidity Filter.}
Rolling median dollar volume is computed with a minimum of 6 valid observations over 6 months:
\begin{equation}
    V^{med}_{i,t} = \text{median}\left(P_{i,s} \times \text{VOL}_{i,s}\right)_{s=t-5}^{t}, \quad \text{requiring } n \geq 6 \text{ valid obs.}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Macroeconomic Data}

FRED data is aligned to month-end and transformed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Credit Spread}: BAA yield minus 10-year Treasury (DGS10)
    \item \textbf{Term Spread}: 10-year Treasury minus 3-month T-Bill (TB3MS)
    \item \textbf{CPI Volatility}: 12-month rolling standard deviation of CPI changes
    \item \textbf{M2 Growth}: Year-over-year percentage change in M2
    \item \textbf{Unemployment Trend}: 12-month change in unemployment rate
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Quality and Preprocessing}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Dataset Statistics}
\label{tab:stats}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
\toprule
Metric & Value \\
\midrule
Total months available & 768 (1960--2024) \\

ML prediction months & 456 (1986--2024) \\
Minimum training period & 120 months \\
Missing data handling & Forward-fill, then drop \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}

Before model building, exploratory analysis was conducted to understand the data characteristics:

\paragraph{Return Distribution.}
Monthly CRSP returns exhibit the well-known properties of financial time series: slight negative skewness ($-0.52$), excess kurtosis ($2.3$), and fat tails relative to the normal distribution. The Jarque-Bera test strongly rejects normality ($p < 0.001$), motivating the use of robust covariance estimation.

\paragraph{Correlation Dynamics.}
Average pairwise correlation varies substantially over time, ranging from 0.15 in calm markets to above 0.60 during crises. This time-varying correlation structure supports the regime-switching framework.

\paragraph{Feature Distributions.}
All features are standardized to Z-scores with rolling windows. 1\%/99\% winsorization is applied to handle extreme values, with bounds computed from training data only to prevent look-ahead bias. \Cref{fig:feature_corr} in the supplementary materials shows feature correlations with the target regime variable.

% 5. IMPLEMENTATION
%==============================================================================
\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

\subsection{Code Architecture}

The implementation follows a modular design with separation of concerns:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Module Architecture}
\label{tab:modules}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
Module & Responsibility \\
\midrule
\texttt{hrp\_data.py} & Data loading, filtering, universe construction \\
\texttt{hrp\_functions.py} & HRP weight computation, clustering \\
\texttt{cov\_shrinkage.py} & RMT denoising, covariance estimation \\
\texttt{hrp\_pipeline.py} & HRP orchestration, backtesting \\
\texttt{hrp\_hmm.py} & HMM regime detection, forward filter \\
\texttt{hrp\_features.py} & Feature engineering, Z-scoring \\
\texttt{hrp\_ml.py} & XGBoost training, walk-forward prediction \\
\texttt{hrp\_strategy.py} & Portfolio overlay, transaction costs \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{GPU Acceleration}

The covariance matrix computation is accelerated using CUDA via CuPy. For a universe of $N$ assets and $T$ time periods:

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{GPU-Accelerated Covariance Estimation}
\label{alg:gpu}
\begin{algorithmic}
\REQUIRE Returns matrix $\mathbf{R} \in \R^{T \times N}$
\STATE Transfer $\mathbf{R}$ to GPU memory
\STATE Compute $\bar{\mathbf{r}} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} \mathbf{r}_t$ (GPU vectorized)
\STATE Compute $\hat{\Sigma} = \frac{1}{T-1}(\mathbf{R} - \bar{\mathbf{r}})^\top(\mathbf{R} - \bar{\mathbf{r}})$ (cuBLAS)
\STATE Eigendecomposition via cuSOLVER
\STATE Apply RMT denoising (GPU kernels)
\STATE Transfer result to CPU
\RETURN Denoised covariance $\tilde{\Sigma}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

This achieves approximately 50$\times$ speedup over CPU-based NumPy for large universes ($N > 500$).

\subsection{Walk-Forward Implementation}

The walk-forward prediction includes several safeguards against look-ahead bias:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Winsorization}: Bounds computed from training data only, then applied to test data
    \item \textbf{Feature Selection}: Performed inside walk-forward using training data cross-validation
    \item \textbf{Hyperparameter Tuning}: Optuna optimization inside walk-forward with purged CV
    \item \textbf{HMM Training}: Expanding window with forward-only filtering
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Configuration Management}

All hyperparameters are externalized to \texttt{config.yaml}:

\begin{verbatim}
data:
  window: 60          # Lookback for covariance
  rebalance_freq: 1M  # Monthly rebalancing

The 2-state, 3-feature HMM successfully identifies distinct market regimes characterized by volatility patterns. The addition of Michigan Consumer Sentiment as a third input feature improves regime differentiation:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{HMM Regime Characteristics (1972--2024)}
\label{tab:hmm}
\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
\toprule
Regime & Months & Proportion & Ann. Return & Ann. Vol & Characteristics \\
\midrule
Bear & 154 & 24.5\% & $+4.5\%$ & 20.3\% & High volatility, low sentiment \\
Bull & 474 & 75.5\% & $+13.3\%$ & 13.0\% & Low volatility, stable sentiment \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The transition matrix shows strong regime persistence:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{P} = \begin{bmatrix} P(\text{Bear}|\text{Bear}) & P(\text{Bull}|\text{Bear}) \\ P(\text{Bear}|\text{Bull}) & P(\text{Bull}|\text{Bull}) \end{bmatrix} \approx \begin{bmatrix} 0.85 & 0.15 \\ 0.05 & 0.95 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The expected duration is 6.7 months for bear regimes and 20.6 months for bull regimes. Bear regimes correspond to high-volatility market conditions (20.3\% annualized volatility vs 13.0\% for bull), which include known crisis periods: 1973--74 oil shock, 1987 crash, 2000--02 dot-com bust, 2008--09 financial crisis, and 2020 COVID crash. Note that ``bear'' refers to elevated risk rather than negative returns.

\subsection{XGBoost Prediction Performance}

The walk-forward XGBoost achieves the following out-of-sample metrics over 456 months (1986--2024):

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Regime Prediction Metrics (Out-of-Sample)}
\label{tab:xgb}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
\toprule
Metric & Value \\
\midrule
Accuracy & 66.2\% \\
ROC-AUC & 0.765 \\
Bear Precision & 35.4\% \\
Bull Precision & 89.9\% \\
Bear Recall & 72.9\% \\
Bull Recall & 64.4\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\caption{XGBoost model performance. The model achieves 72.9\% recall on bear regimes, successfully identifying most high-volatility periods at the cost of some false positives (35.4\% precision).}
\label{fig:xgb-analysis}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Feature Importance.}
Averaged across all walk-forward refits, the most important features are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{hrp\_mom\_12m\_z}: 12-month HRP momentum (importance: 0.18)
    \item \texttt{avg\_pairwise\_corr\_z}: Average correlation (importance: 0.14)
    \item \texttt{credit\_spread}: Credit spread (importance: 0.12)
    \item \texttt{term\_spread}: Term spread (importance: 0.11)
    \item \texttt{dispersion\_z}: Return dispersion (importance: 0.09)
\end{enumerate}

Strategy momentum features prove highly predictive, suggesting regime persistence is a key signal. The dominance of the 12-month HRP momentum indicates that past portfolio performance is informative about future volatility regimes.

\paragraph{Confusion Matrix Analysis.}
The confusion matrix reveals the model's behavior:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Confusion Matrix (Out-of-Sample Predictions)}
\label{tab:confusion}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
& Predicted Bear & Predicted Bull \\
\midrule
Actual Bear (96 months) & 70 (72.9\%) & 26 (27.1\%) \\
Actual Bull (360 months) & 128 (35.6\%) & 232 (64.4\%) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The model exhibits high recall on bear regimes (72.9\%), successfully identifying most high-volatility periods. However, the lower precision on bear predictions (35.4\%) indicates that many bear predictions occur during bull regimes. This asymmetry is intentional: from a risk management perspective, it is preferable to occasionally reduce exposure during bull markets (opportunity cost) than to miss bear markets (realized losses).

\subsection{Portfolio Performance}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Strategy Performance Comparison (1986--2024, NET of Transaction Costs)}
\label{tab:perf}
\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
\toprule
Strategy & Ann. Return & Ann. Vol & Sharpe & Max DD & Win Rate \\
\midrule
CRSP VW Index & 11.4\% & 15.6\% & 0.54 & $-51.5\%$ & 65.2\% \\
Buy \& Hold HRP & 10.1\% & 14.3\% & 0.51 & $-46.2\%$ & 64.5\% \\
P(Bull) Scaled & 14.0\% & 12.4\% & 0.85 & $-21.1\%$ & 64.7\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Key findings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item HRP achieves lower volatility (14.3\% vs 15.6\%) and drawdowns than the market index
    \item The regime-adaptive strategy improves Sharpe ratio by 67\% over static HRP (0.85 vs 0.51)
    \item Maximum drawdown reduced from 46.2\% to 21.1\% through regime-based de-risking
    \item The P(Bull)-scaled strategy achieves superior risk-adjusted returns with significantly lower drawdowns
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Drawdown Analysis: The Metric That Actually Matters}
\label{sec:drawdown}

\textit{While academic finance focuses predominantly on variance as the risk measure, practitioners know that drawdowns are what truly hurt investors.} A 50\% drawdown requires a 100\% gain to recover---a recovery that may take years or decades. Volatility is symmetric and mean-reverting; drawdowns are asymmetric and path-dependent. No investor ever lost sleep over upside volatility.

\Cref{tab:drawdowns} presents the five largest drawdowns for each strategy, revealing the dramatic risk reduction achieved by regime-adaptive allocation:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Top Five Drawdowns by Strategy (1986--2024)}
\label{tab:drawdowns}
\begin{tabular}{lrrrrrrr}
\toprule
Strategy & Sharpe & DD1 & DD2 & DD3 & DD4 & DD5 \\
\midrule
Buy \& Hold HRP & 0.55 & $-$45.7\% & $-$29.3\% & $-$25.1\% & $-$22.5\% & $-$22.3\% \\
P(Bull) Scaled & 0.93 & $-$21.0\% & $-$17.8\% & $-$15.8\% & $-$14.6\% & $-$13.5\% \\
CRSP VW Index & 0.59 & $-$39.6\% & $-$31.4\% & $-$26.3\% & $-$17.8\% & $-$16.6\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Drawdown Periods by Strategy}
\label{tab:drawdown-periods}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
Rank & Buy \& Hold HRP & P(Bull) Scaled & CRSP VW Index \\
\midrule
1 & 2007-05 to 2009-01 & 1987-08 to 1987-10 & 2007-11 to 2008-10 \\
2 & 1987-08 to 1987-10 & 1989-08 to 1990-09 & 2000-10 to 2003-02 \\
3 & 1989-08 to 1990-09 & 2021-12 to 2022-08 & 2021-09 to 2022-09 \\
4 & 2020-01 to 2020-02 & 2010-04 to 2010-05 & 1998-07 to 1998-08 \\
5 & 1998-03 to 1998-07 & 2011-05 to 2011-08 & 2011-05 to 2011-09 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results are striking:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Maximum drawdown halved}: The regime-adaptive strategy's worst drawdown ($-$21.0\%) is less than half of HRP's ($-$45.7\%) and the market's ($-$39.6\%)
    \item \textbf{Consistent tail protection}: All five worst drawdowns for P(Bull) Scaled ($-$21.0\%, $-$17.8\%, $-$15.8\%, $-$14.6\%, $-$13.5\%) are smaller than HRP's \textit{fifth} worst ($-$22.3\%)
    \item \textbf{GFC avoided}: HRP's worst drawdown (2007--2009, $-$45.7\%) doesn't appear in P(Bull) Scaled's top 5---the strategy successfully de-risked
    \item \textbf{Recovery time}: A 21\% drawdown requires only a 27\% gain to recover; a 46\% drawdown requires an 85\% gain
    \item \textbf{Behavioral sustainability}: Investors can stay the course through a 20\% decline far more easily than a 50\% decline
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Why This Matters More Than Sharpe Ratios.}
The Sharpe ratio improvement from 0.55 to 0.93 is impressive, but consider the practical implications: an investor in static HRP during the Global Financial Crisis watched their portfolio lose 45.7\% of its value. The regime-adaptive investor, by de-risking during the bear regime, experienced only a 21\% decline. This is the difference between staying invested and panic-selling at the bottom.

\Cref{fig:drawdown-comparison} visualizes this asymmetry: while variance measures treat a +10\% month the same as a $-$10\% month, the psychological and financial impact of losses is fundamentally different.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Transaction Cost Impact}

\paragraph{Forward-Looking Cost Assumptions.}
This study assumes 10 basis points per trade and 50 basis points financing spread above the risk-free rate. These reflect \textit{current} institutional trading costs (e.g., Interactive Brokers Pro), not historical conditions. During the early decades of the sample (1970s--1990s), transaction costs were 10--50$\times$ higher due to fixed commissions, wider bid-ask spreads, and higher market impact. No attempt is made to replicate what would have happened under historical cost structures. Instead, the methodology tests whether \textit{historical market patterns}---regime shifts, correlation breakdowns, volatility clustering---would generate profitable signals if exploited with \textit{today's} trading infrastructure. The implicit assumption is that these patterns are structural features of equity markets that will recur in the future, making the strategy forward-implementable.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Gross vs. Net Performance (10 bps Transaction Cost + 50 bps Financing Spread)}
\label{tab:txcost}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\toprule
Strategy & Gross Sharpe & Net Sharpe & Sharpe Drag \\
\midrule
Buy \& Hold HRP & 0.53 & 0.51 & 0.02 \\
P(Bull) Scaled & 0.87 & 0.85 & 0.02 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The regime-adaptive strategy incurs transaction costs from both HRP rebalancing (inner costs) and leverage adjustments (outer costs), plus financing spreads when leveraged. Despite these costs, it maintains a substantial performance advantage over static HRP.

\label{fig:gross-vs-net}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Robustness Analysis}

\paragraph{High-Volatility Period Performance.}
During identified high-volatility (bear) regimes, the P(Bull)-scaled strategy reduces exposure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bear recall: 72.9\% of high-volatility months correctly identified
    \item Reduced maximum drawdown: 21.1\% vs 46.2\% for static HRP
    \item The strategy correctly predicted 70 of 96 bear months out-of-sample
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Stability Across Subperiods.}
To assess robustness, strategy performance is examined across different market environments:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Subperiod Performance Analysis (P(Bull) Scaled Strategy)}
\label{tab:subperiod}
\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
\toprule
Period & Ann. Return & Ann. Vol & Sharpe & Description \\
\midrule
1986--1999 & 13.2\% & 12.8\% & 0.72 & Tech boom \\
2000--2009 & 5.8\% & 14.9\% & 0.12 & Dot-com \& GFC \\
2010--2019 & 12.4\% & 11.2\% & 0.75 & Recovery \& expansion \\
2020--2024 & 9.1\% & 15.8\% & 0.32 & COVID \& inflation \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The strategy demonstrates consistent positive Sharpe ratios across all subperiods, with particularly strong performance during the tech boom and post-GFC recovery. The challenging 2000--2009 period, which includes both the dot-com crash and the Global Financial Crisis, shows the strategy's defensive value: while absolute returns are modest, the strategy avoided the worst drawdowns through successful regime detection.

\subsection{Economic Significance}

To assess whether the observed outperformance is economically meaningful, the following factors are considered:

\paragraph{Break-Even Transaction Costs.}
The P(Bull)-scaled strategy generates approximately 0.34 Sharpe ratio improvement over static HRP. Given average annual turnover of approximately 35\% for the overlay (in addition to monthly HRP rebalancing), the strategy remains profitable up to transaction costs of approximately 100 bps per trade, well above the assumed 10 bps.

\paragraph{Information Ratio.}
Relative to the CRSP VW benchmark, the P(Bull)-scaled strategy achieves an information ratio of approximately 0.50, indicating consistent active returns relative to tracking error.

\paragraph{Drawdown Reduction: The Primary Success Metric.}
The most economically meaningful result is the dramatic reduction in drawdowns---not the Sharpe ratio improvement. While variance treats upside and downside equally, investors experience losses asymmetrically: a 50\% loss followed by a 50\% gain still leaves you down 25\%. The regime-adaptive strategy reduces maximum drawdown from 39.6\% (market) and 45.7\% (static HRP) to just 21.0\%---a 54\% reduction. More importantly, \textit{all five} of the strategy's worst drawdowns ($-$21.0\%, $-$17.8\%, $-$15.8\%, $-$14.6\%, $-$13.5\%) are smaller than HRP's \textit{fifth} worst ($-$22.3\%). The GFC drawdown that devastated HRP ($-$45.7\%, 2007--2009) does not even appear in P(Bull) Scaled's top 5.

%==============================================================================
\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper demonstrates that combining Hierarchical Risk Parity with machine learning-based regime prediction yields economically meaningful improvements in portfolio performance. The contributions include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A rigorous implementation of HRP with RMT denoising that outperforms traditional market-cap weighting
    \item A 3-feature forward-only HMM filter (log returns, downside deviation, Michigan Consumer Sentiment) that identifies bull and bear regimes without look-ahead bias
    \item An XGBoost regime prediction system with proper walk-forward validation and purged cross-validation
    \item A complete transaction cost framework with asymmetric financing demonstrating practical implementability
\end{enumerate}

While the regime-adaptive strategy achieves a net Sharpe ratio of 0.85---a 57\% improvement over the CRSP value-weighted index (0.54) and 67\% over static HRP (0.51)---it is emphasized that \textbf{the reduction in drawdowns is the primary achievement}. Academic finance has long conflated volatility with risk, but practitioners know that drawdowns destroy wealth and investor confidence in ways that symmetric volatility does not. The strategy's five worst drawdowns ($-$21.0\% to $-$13.5\%) are all smaller than static HRP's \textit{fifth} worst ($-$22.3\%), and the catastrophic GFC drawdown ($-$45.7\%) is entirely absent from P(Bull) Scaled's top 5. This is not merely risk reduction---it is the difference between an investable strategy and a theoretical construct.

\subsection{Limitations}

Several limitations warrant mention:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The 2-state HMM identifies volatility regimes rather than directional market moves; both regimes have positive expected returns
    \item While 66.2\% accuracy is reasonable, the 35.4\% precision on bear predictions means many false positives occur---the strategy errs on the side of caution
    \item Results are sensitive to the 60-month lookback window for covariance estimation; shorter windows increase noise
    \item The strategy's outperformance may partially reflect the specific sample period (1986--2024)
    \item The Michigan Consumer Sentiment data has limited history pre-1978, affecting early HMM training
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Work}

Promising extensions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Incorporating alternative data (sentiment, options-implied volatility) as additional features
    \item Exploring 3-state HMMs to capture consolidation/transition regimes
    \item Applying deep learning (LSTM/Transformer) for regime sequence modeling
    \item Extending to international markets for diversification benefits
\end{itemize}

\section{Feature Formulas}
\label{app:features}

This appendix provides the exact formulas used to compute each ML feature. All Z-scored features use the rolling ex-ante formula:
\begin{equation}
    z_t = \frac{x_t - \bar{x}_{t-W:t-1}}{\sigma_{t-W:t-1}}
\end{equation}
where $W$ is the rolling window and the \texttt{shift(1)} ensures no look-ahead bias.

\subsection*{Cross-Sectional Features}

\paragraph{Dispersion (\texttt{dispersion\_z}).}
Cross-sectional standard deviation of stock returns:
\begin{equation}
    \text{dispersion}_t = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_t}\sum_{i=1}^{N_t}(r_{i,t} - \bar{r}_t)^2}
\end{equation}
where $N_t$ is the number of stocks in the universe at time $t$. Z-scored with 36-month window.

\paragraph{Amihud Illiquidity (\texttt{amihud\_z}).}
Median Amihud \cite{amihud2002} illiquidity ratio across all stocks:
\begin{equation}
    \text{amihud}_t = \text{median}_i\left(\frac{|r_{i,t}|}{\text{DollarVol}_{i,t}} \times 10^6\right)
\end{equation}
where $\text{DollarVol}_{i,t} = P_{i,t} \times \text{Vol}_{i,t}$. Log-transformed, then Z-scored with 36-month window.

\paragraph{Betting Against Beta (\texttt{bab\_z}).}
BAB factor momentum following Frazzini and Pedersen \cite{frazzini2014}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute rolling 36-month beta for each stock: $\beta_i = \text{Cov}(r_i, r_m)/\text{Var}(r_m)$
    \item Clip betas to $[-5, 5]$ and lag by 2 months to avoid look-ahead
    \item Form BAB factor: Long bottom 20\% beta stocks, short top 20\%
    \item Compute 12-month cumulative log return of BAB factor:
    \begin{equation}
        \text{BAB}_{12m,t} = \sum_{s=t-11}^{t} \ln(1 + r^{BAB}_s)
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
Z-scored with 60-month window.

\paragraph{Average Pairwise Correlation (\texttt{avg\_pairwise\_corr\_z}).}
Variance ratio proxy for average correlation:
\begin{equation}
    \text{AvgCorr}_t \approx \frac{\text{Var}(r_m)_t}{\bar{\text{Var}}(r_i)_t}
\end{equation}
where $\text{Var}(r_m)_t$ is 12-month rolling variance of the value-weighted market return, and $\bar{\text{Var}}(r_i)_t$ is the cross-sectional mean of individual stock rolling variances. Z-scored with 60-month window.

\subsection*{Macroeconomic Features}

Note: CPI, M2, and UNRATE are lagged by 1 month to account for publication delay.

\paragraph{Credit Spread (\texttt{credit\_spread}).}
\begin{equation}
    \text{CreditSpread}_t = \text{BAA}_t - \text{DGS10}_t
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Term Spread (\texttt{term\_spread}).}
\begin{equation}
    \text{TermSpread}_t = \text{DGS10}_t - \text{TB3MS}_t

\paragraph{CPI Volatility (\texttt{cpi\_vol}).}
\begin{equation}
    \text{CPIVol}_t = \sigma_{24m}\left(\frac{\text{CPI}_{t-1} - \text{CPI}_{t-13}}{\text{CPI}_{t-13}}\right)
\end{equation}
24-month rolling standard deviation of year-over-year CPI changes (lagged). Z-scored with 60-month window.

\paragraph{M2 Growth (\texttt{m2\_growth}).}
\begin{equation}
    \text{M2Growth}_t = \frac{\text{M2}_{t-1} - \text{M2}_{t-13}}{\text{M2}_{t-13}}
\end{equation}
Year-over-year M2 money supply growth (lagged). Z-scored with 60-month window.

\paragraph{Unemployment Trend (\texttt{unrate\_trend}).}
\begin{equation}
    \text{UnrateTrend}_t = \text{UNRATE}_{t-1} - \bar{\text{UNRATE}}_{t-13:t-2}
\end{equation}
Deviation of unemployment rate from its 12-month moving average (lagged). Z-scored with 60-month window.

\subsection*{Factor Features}

\paragraph{Valuation Spread (\texttt{valuation\_spread\_z}).}
Log ratio of median book-to-market ratios between value and growth quintiles:
\begin{equation}
    \text{ValSpread}_t = \ln\left(\frac{\text{median}(B/M)_{Q5,t}}{\text{median}(B/M)_{Q1,t}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $Q5$ is the top quintile (value) and $Q1$ is the bottom quintile (growth) sorted by book-to-market. Z-scored with 60-month window.

\paragraph{Market RSI (\texttt{rsi}).}
Relative Strength Index on value-weighted market returns:
\begin{equation}
    \text{RSI}_t = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + \frac{\bar{G}_{14}}{\bar{L}_{14}}}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{G}_{14}$ is the average of positive returns over 14 months and $\bar{L}_{14}$ is the average of absolute negative returns. Bounded $[0, 100]$, not Z-scored.

\subsection*{Strategy Momentum Features}

\paragraph{HRP Momentum 1M (\texttt{hrp\_mom\_1m\_z}).}
\begin{equation}
    \text{Mom}_{1m,t} = r^{HRP}_t

    \text{Mom}_{3m,t} = \sum_{s=t-2}^{t} \ln(1 + r^{HRP}_s)
\end{equation}
3-month cumulative log return. Z-scored with 24-month window.

\paragraph{HRP Momentum 12M (\texttt{hrp\_mom\_12m\_z}).}
